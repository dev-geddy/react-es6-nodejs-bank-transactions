# My Transactions Interpreting Tool
Application purpose is to parse bank transactions history from CSV file,
categorise & aggregate expenses and visualise balance over time.

## How to run
Once project is checked out, run the following commands:
  npm install
  npm start

#### If you're using Windows
If *npm start* does not start the application, start app and api in separate terminals by running commands:
- npm run api
- npm run app

Unfortunately API upload handling does not work on windows environment yet.
